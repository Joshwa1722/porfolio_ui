Projects worked
FCS Admin UI is a web-based admin dashboard for First Credit Services, a US-based debt collection

  system features role-based access control, automated collection workflows, real-time analytics         dashboards, and compliance management to help collection agents and administrators efficiently track,   communicate with, and recover debts.      


  DataVUI is a web-based data visualization and analytics platform where users can connect to various    databases, create interactive charts and visualizations from their data, organize them into          
  customizable dashboards with drag-and-drop layouts, set up alerts for specific data conditions, and    manage user access through role-based permissions — essentially turning raw data into visual,
  actionable insights.
